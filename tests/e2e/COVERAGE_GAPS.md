# E2E Coverage Gaps

A prioritised audit of behaviour that is **not** yet exercised by the
existing browser-driven Playwright suite (`panel.spec.ts`,
`settings.spec.ts`, `onboarding.spec.ts`, `playground.spec.ts`) or by the
Vitest/cargo unit layers.

The grouping is by *return on engineering minute*, not by importance of the
underlying feature: a critical path that is trivially fakeable beats a
nice-to-have that needs a new shim plumbing pass.

| Tier | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **A — High value, easy** | Pure shim/override work. No new infra. ≤ 30 min/test. |
| **B — High value, harder** | Needs new shim plumbing or a Rust hook. Hours, not days. |
| **C — Nice to have** | Polish/parity tests. Low regression risk if skipped. |

Each row gives the **target file** (where the new spec should live), a
one-line **approach**, and the rough **shape** of what to assert.

---

## A. High value / easy

### A1. Panel state-machine: `back()` from result → picking
- **Target:** `panel.spec.ts`
- **What to test:** From a completed result, clicking the back affordance
  (`Backspace` keystroke or the back button in `ResultView`) returns to
  the action picker with the **same selection** preserved.
- **Approach:** Reuse the existing mocked stream override; after
  `result-text` resolves, press `Backspace`, then assert the actions
  listbox + the selection preview are both visible again and the
  preview text matches the seeded selection.
- **Why it's easy:** `store.ts`'s `back()` action is pure; the
  observable contract is just DOM presence.

### A2. Panel state-machine: `retry()` re-streams from error and from result
- **Target:** `panel.spec.ts`
- **What to test:** Two cases:
  1. Click **Retry** on an error view → goes back to streaming with the
     same `action`/`selection`, eventually resolves to result.
  2. Click **Retry** on the result view → resets tokens to empty and
     re-streams.
- **Approach:** Two overrides in sequence — first an `error` override,
  swap to a `stream` override before clicking Retry. Or have one
  `stream` override returning different tokens on the second call (a
  call-count counter on the shim).
- **Why it's easy:** `setCompletionOverride` already supports swapping
  between calls.

### A3. Malformed SSE chunk is swallowed without crashing the stream
- **Target:** Rust unit — extend `src-tauri/src/llm/sse.rs`'s `tests`
  module. Plus one e2e check.
- **What to test:**
  - **Rust:** `parse_data_line` returns `Err` for invalid JSON, `Ok(None)`
    for `data: {} ` and `data: {"choices":[]}` — confirm `gateway` swallows
    parse errors and the stream continues (today's test only covers
    `[DONE]` and the happy path).
  - **E2E:** Add a new override shape `kind: "raw_sse"` that emits a
    mix of valid + malformed chunks. Confirm the result view still
    shows the concatenation of the *valid* tokens.
- **Approach:** Cargo-side is a direct unit test. The e2e variant needs
  one new override branch in `shims/commands.ts`.

### A4. Timeout / read-stall surfaces as a classified error
- **Target:** `panel.spec.ts`
- **What to test:** An override that resolves the HTTP call but never
  emits a token (or emits one then hangs) is treated as a
  *both-failed* (or whatever the registry settles on for timeouts).
  Today's error test only covers HTTP 401.
- **Approach:** `kind: "stall"` override → backend should bail after its
  read-timeout. If the existing gateway has no timeout for stalled
  streams, that's itself a bug worth surfacing — the test should fail
  loudly.

### A5. HTTP 429 classifies as `rate-limit`
- **Target:** `panel.spec.ts`
- **What to test:** `error` override with body `"HTTP 429 too many
  requests"` → `[data-error-kind="rate-limit"]` is visible, primary
  action label is *"Use fallback"*.
- **Approach:** Mirror the existing 401 test exactly; just change the
  error string. Cheapest test in the file.

### A6. Context-overflow classifies + primary action is "Switch model"
- **Target:** `panel.spec.ts`
- **What to test:** Error body containing `context_length_exceeded`
  classifies to `context-overflow`. Primary button label is *"Switch
  model"*.
- **Approach:** Same shape as A5. Pair with the existing
  `errorKinds.test.ts` assertion to keep classifier + UI in lockstep.

### A7. `dev_panel_persistent` change actually disables auto-hide on blur
- **Target:** `settings.spec.ts` (or a new `panel-behaviour.spec.ts`)
- **What to test:** Today the suite only checks the **persistence** of the
  toggle (round-trips into the store). It does not assert the
  **behaviour**: that `Panel.tsx` no longer calls `hide_panel` when the
  flag is on.
- **Approach:** Seed `dev_panel_persistent: true`, mount panel, emit a
  blur via `window.dispatchEvent(new Event("blur"))`, assert
  `isPanelVisible(page)` stays true. Mirror with `false`.

### A8. Settings persistence round-trip via a *real* reload
- **Target:** `settings.spec.ts`
- **What to test:** Today most settings tests poll
  `window.__TEST__.getSettings()`, which reads the in-memory shim.
  Add one regression spec that mutates a setting, calls `page.reload()`,
  and asserts the value is re-read on mount.
- **Approach:** The shim already persists to sessionStorage when
  `setSettings` is called; a reload exercises the load path. If today's
  shim doesn't, that's the gap — wire it up.

### A9. Model picker shows context-length chips
- **Target:** New `model-picker.spec.ts`
- **What to test:** Open the modal from Settings → Default models →
  Fireworks; assert each row that has `context_length` renders the
  `"… ctx"` badge with the formatted value (`131K`, `1M`).
- **Approach:** Seed the shim's `fetchModels` return with a fixed
  catalog that includes context lengths; open the picker; query
  `.model-picker__ctx`.

### A10. `SelectionPreview` expand → collapse toggle round-trip
- **Target:** `panel.spec.ts`
- **What to test:** Emit a 5,000-char selection → `long-selection-badge`
  visible → click it → full text visible **and**
  `long-selection-collapse` visible → click it → back to truncated.
  Today's `__tests__/SelectionPreview.test.tsx` covers the static
  render but not the toggle round-trip in the panel context.
- **Approach:** Trivial — wire it through `emitSelection` with a long
  text and click the two test-ids.

### A11. Disabled actions are filtered out of the picker
- **Target:** `panel.spec.ts`
- **What to test:** Seed `enabled_actions: ["summarize", "edit"]`,
  emit selection, assert only the two buttons render. Today's tests
  always assert all four.
- **Approach:** One-line settings seed; existing role-query assertions.

### A12. `cancelCompletion` mid-stream drops to idle
- **Target:** `panel.spec.ts` (the mocked twin to `playground.spec.ts`'s
  live cancel test)
- **What to test:** Mocked long stream + click cancel + assert the
  panel goes to idle and no result fires after.
- **Approach:** Long `tokenIntervalMs`; call `cancelCompletion` via the
  shim after one token; assert listbox returns or panel idles.

---

## B. High value / harder

### B1. Provider-failover contract: `provider_switched` arrives before any OpenRouter token
- **Target:** `panel.spec.ts` (assertion) + Rust unit
- **What to test:** This is the load-bearing contract called out in
  `lib.rs` / `store.ts` comments. Today's `provider_switched resets the
  streaming buffer` test asserts the *consequence* (final buffer is
  post-switch tokens) but does not pin the *order* of events.
- **Approach:** Add an in-shim event recorder that timestamps every
  `__TEST__`-observable event (`completion_token`,
  `provider_switched`, …). Assert that no `completion_token` payload
  attributed to OpenRouter is recorded before
  `provider_switched`. On the Rust side, a `wiremock` test for the
  gateway with a Fireworks 500 + OpenRouter happy stream, asserting on
  callback ordering.
- **Why it's harder:** Needs a small event-trace plumb-through on the
  shim and a new wiremock fixture.

### B2. Partial-stream abort restores clipboard
- **Target:** New `paste-back.spec.ts` (mocked) **or** a `cargo test`
- **What to test:** `paste_back` writes new text → cancel/abort
  mid-paste (e.g. by panel hide) → previous clipboard is restored. The
  current `selection.rs` has the restore logic
  (`tracing::warn!("paste_back: clipboard restore failed …")`) but
  no test covers the success path of the restore.
- **Approach:** In the shim: track every clipboard write in order;
  assert the *last* entry equals the seeded "previous" clipboard, not
  the result text, when an abort path runs.
- **Why it's harder:** Needs an abort hook in the shim — today
  `synthesize_paste` is monolithic.

### B3. Settings live-rebind survives hotkey change
- **Target:** New `hotkey-live-rebind.spec.ts`
- **What to test:** Set hotkey A, fire the chord → panel shows. Change
  to hotkey B → A no longer shows the panel, B does. Exercises the
  `set_hotkey → hotkey::reregister` path in `commands/settings.rs`.
- **Approach:** Today the shim probably doesn't synthesise a global
  shortcut. Add a fake `globalShortcut.register` table to the shim and
  let tests "press" by name.
- **Why it's harder:** Needs a new shim surface for the
  `plugin-global-shortcut` API.

### B4. A11y probe failure path
- **Target:** `onboarding.spec.ts`
- **What to test:** The shim's `probe_accessibility` is hardcoded to
  return `true` (see `tests/e2e/onboarding.spec.ts` header comment), so
  the *denied* branch of step 1 is untested: button stays disabled,
  copy reads "waiting on Accessibility", "Open System Settings" remains
  the primary CTA.
- **Approach:** Add `__TEST__.setProbeAccessibility(boolean)` to the
  shim. Seed false; assert the disabled state; flip to true and assert
  the auto-advance.
- **Why it's harder:** Needs a new shim toggle (small but new surface).

### B5. Onboarding back-navigation (negative / regression)
- **Target:** `onboarding.spec.ts`
- **What to test:** `Onboarding.tsx` is forward-only — there is no Back
  button on any step. This is a regression hazard: if a future contributor
  wires `setStep(step - 1)` on a stray key handler, we'd want to know.
- **Approach:** Add a regression test: navigate to step 3, press
  `Backspace` and `Escape`, assert the active step is still 3 and
  `step-2` is **not** visible.
- **Why it's harder:** The "test for absence" framing is fine, but
  watch for false positives if/when Back is intentionally added.

### B5b. Onboarding partial completion (window-close mid-flow)
- **Target:** `onboarding.spec.ts`
- **What to test:** If the user closes the onboarding window after step
  2 (Fireworks key saved) but before step 4 (Finish), then re-opens the
  app:
  1. `onboarding_complete` stays `false`,
  2. the saved Fireworks key is preserved (user does not have to retype),
  3. re-mounting `/onboarding` starts at step 1 (or — decide whether we
     want to resume at the highest reached step; pin the choice here).
- **Approach:** Walk to step 3, call `page.reload()`, re-assert. Today
  the route always starts at step 1 — that's worth pinning in either
  direction.
- **Why it's harder:** Forces us to decide and document the resume policy,
  not just write a passing test.

### B6. Fireworks `validate_api_key` failure modes (not just the happy/sad live tests)
- **Target:** `src-tauri/tests/` (new wiremock-backed `validate.rs`) +
  one e2e spec
- **What to test:** Today the live spec checks "real key OK" and
  "bogus key err". Cover the documented mid-life-cycle case from
  `CLAUDE.md` — a 404 with body `"… and/or not deployed"` (model
  retired) — surfaces as a classified error in the validate UI, not a
  raw error string.
- **Approach:** Stub Fireworks `/v1/models` with wiremock to return
  404+ body; assert mapped error string contains a user-readable
  "model retired" hint.

### B7. `tauri-plugin-store` migration / forward-compat at the deserialize boundary
- **Target:** Extend `src-tauri/src/settings.rs` tests
- **What to test:** Today's test covers an "unknown_field" but not the
  *removal* of a known field — e.g. an old store with the deprecated
  shape (a setting we later drop) should not panic on load. Also: an
  old store missing `dev_panel_persistent` should default to `false`.
- **Approach:** Cargo-side parametrised tests over a few historical
  JSON shapes.

### B8. OpenRouter context-length search query (`128k`, `1m`, `200000`)
- **Target:** New `model-picker.spec.ts` (paired with A9)
- **What to test:** Typing `128k` filters rows to those with
  `context_length >= 128000` *or* a literal id match; `1m` works the
  same; `70000` (bare) is below the 4-digit floor and does **not** match
  context-only. Today this lives in `parseCtxQuery` and isn't covered.
- **Approach:** Seed the modal with a mixed-context catalog (some
  rows with no `context_length` at all), type the query, assert the
  visible row count and contents. Pair with a Vitest unit test on
  `parseCtxQuery`.
- **Why it's harder:** Needs the same fixture work as A9 plus a
  parametrised set of queries.

---

## C. Nice to have

### C1. Edge-flip / clamp positioning under multi-monitor extremes
- **Target:** `src-tauri/src/window/panel.rs` (already has clamp tests,
  add edge-flip cases)
- **What to test:** Verify the *flip* branch when both X and Y would
  overflow; verify the clamp acts as last-resort after a flip still
  overflows (panel taller than monitor). Today's tests cover clamp
  alone.

### C2. Telemetry overlay toggle (`⌘⇧;`)
- **Target:** New `telemetry.spec.ts`
- **What to test:** Press the chord with the panel mounted; overlay
  becomes visible; press again; it hides. Today `telemetry.test.ts`
  covers the data plumbing but not the keybinding.

### C3. `ProviderIndicator` flips between Fireworks ↔ OpenRouter on switch
- **Target:** `panel.spec.ts`
- **What to test:** Visual regression-ish — after a provider switch
  the indicator's `data-provider` (or text) changes. The buffer
  reset test already provokes a switch; just add one more assertion.

### C4. Tray menu items wire to the right commands
- **Target:** New `tray.spec.ts` (or a unit in the shim)
- **What to test:** Open the tray, click "Settings…" → settings
  window opens via the shim's `open` log; click "Playground…" (debug
  build only) → playground opens.
- **Approach:** Shim already records `opens()`; just expose tray
  click APIs.

### C5. `Restore default` for prompt overrides clears across a reload
- **Target:** `settings.spec.ts`
- **What to test:** Set + save override, reload, restore, reload —
  override is still cleared on second mount. Partial coverage today
  (no reload).

### C6. Lint/typecheck-level: dead state branches in `store.ts`
- **Target:** `src/lib/store.test.ts`
- **What to test:** Every "intentional no-op when called from the wrong
  source state" branch — e.g. `appendToken` while `kind === "result"`,
  `completeResult` while `kind === "picking"`. The store comment promises
  these no-op; add a sweep test that asserts the state object is
  reference-equal after each illegal call.

### C7. Selection capture: empty selection produces an offline-preflight error
- **Target:** New `selection-capture.spec.ts`
- **What to test:** Emit a `selection_captured` event with empty text
  → panel surfaces an "empty selection" affordance, not a streaming
  state.

### C8. Rust gateway: HTTP/2 ALPN negotiation regression
- **Target:** `src-tauri/src/llm/gateway.rs` tests
- **What to test:** A regression guard for the comment in `init_client`
  ("`http2_prior_knowledge` is intentionally OFF"). Wiremock with TLS
  termination is fiddly; a smaller test is "the client builder does not
  enable `http2_prior_knowledge`" by asserting on its config (where
  reqwest exposes it) or by an inspection test on `Client::builder`.

## Rust-side gaps in `prompts.rs` and `provider_impl.rs`

The two LLM-adjacent Rust modules are already the best-covered code in
the backend (override/placeholder/max_tokens matrix; fetch_models parse
+ status mapping). Remaining gaps:

### `src-tauri/src/llm/prompts.rs`

- **P1. Multi-placeholder substitution.** `build_messages_with_override`
  uses `String::replace`, which substitutes **every** `{text}` occurrence.
  No test pins this contract — pin it so a future `replacen(.., 1)`
  refactor breaks loudly.
- **P2. Round-trip `as_key()` ↔ `from_str(…)`.** Today each
  `Action::ALL` entry asserts `as_key()` matches the lowercase string,
  but the reverse direction is only asserted via the `"invalid"` case.
  Add one explicit loop:
  `for a in Action::ALL { assert_eq!(Action::from_str(a.as_key()).unwrap(), a); }`.
- **P3. `max_tokens_for(Edit, 0)` does not panic.** The current expression
  is `((text_chars / 3) as u32).clamp(120, 600)` — division by zero
  isn't a risk, but `text_chars = 0` is an unusual input worth pinning.
- **P4. Empty `text` still produces a valid user prompt.** Pin that
  `build_messages(Summarize, "")` returns a user message whose content
  ends with `:\n\n` (does not crash, does not strip the framing).

### `src-tauri/src/llm/provider_impl.rs`

- **PI1. Forward-compat on extra fields.** Fireworks `/v1/models` rows
  in the wild carry many fields (`owned_by`, `created`, `parent`,
  `kind`, …). Today's mock omits them. Add a test where the JSON has
  a half-dozen unknown fields per row — assert parse still succeeds.
- **PI2. `?page_size=20` query param is on the Fireworks URL.** The
  current wiremock matchers do not assert the query string at all.
  Add `.and(query_param("page_size", "20"))` so a regression that
  drops or renames the pagination param fails loudly.
- **PI3. Attribution headers (`HTTP-Referer`, `X-Title`) are sent.**
  These are required by OpenRouter for rate-limit attribution. No
  test asserts they ride on the request. Add header matchers.
- **PI4. 5xx mapping → `ServerError`.** 503/504 are common in the wild
  but unmapped by tests. Add a 503 case in `fetch_models_*` and
  assert `ProviderError::ServerError`.
- **PI5. Network error mapping.** TCP refused / DNS fail →
  `ProviderError::Network`. Today there's no test for this branch.
  Easiest path: point `base_url_override` at a closed port
  (`http://127.0.0.1:1`) and assert.
- **PI6. `factory_returns_correct_kind()` should also assert
  `label()` and `default_model()`.** The test only checks `kind()`,
  but the trait surface includes the other two — a renamed default
  in `default_model()` would not be caught.

---

## Suggested order of attack

1. **A5, A6, A11, A10** — five lines each. Knock them out in one PR.
2. **A1, A2, A7** — covers the panel state-machine edges the store
   was explicitly designed for.
3. **A3, A4** — the parser/error surfaces. Adds confidence under flaky
   network conditions.
4. **A8, A9** — settings/model picker assertion gaps.
5. **B1, B4, B5** — contract-level guarantees; worth the small shim
   investments.
6. **B6, B7, B8** — backend correctness gaps.
7. **Rust gaps `P1`/`PI1`–`PI3`** — five-minute wins on the
   best-tested module; close them while you're already there.
8. The C tier is optional and can ride along with feature work.

## Supplements (2026-05-27 re-audit)

Adds gaps found by a second sweep that aren't represented above. Same
A/B/C tiering.

### S1. `formatCtx` / `parseCtxQuery` direct unit tests *(A-tier)*
- **Target:** new `src/components/__tests__/ModelPickerModal.test.tsx`.
- **Why:** B8 covers context-length search e2e, but the two helpers in
  [`ModelPickerModal.tsx`](src/components/ModelPickerModal.tsx) are pure
  and have no direct unit coverage. A regression in the bare-number floor
  (`>= 1000`) or `M` vs `K` rounding would only surface via B8's slower
  path.
- **Sketch:** Re-export the helpers and table-drive them.
  `"128k"→128_000`, `"1m"→1_000_000`, `"1.5m"→1_500_000`,
  `"200000"→200_000`, `"500"→null`, `"foo"→null`, `"  128k  "→128_000`,
  `"-1"→null`. For `formatCtx`: `131072→"131K"`, `1_000_000→"1M"`,
  `1_048_576→"1M"` (rounding), `999→"999"`.

### S2. ModelDropdown row shows `context_length` chip *(A-tier)*
- **Target:** extend `src/components/__tests__/ModelDropdown.test.tsx`.
- **Why:** A9 hits the *Settings* surface; the unit-level component
  test never asserts that a mocked `fetchModels` row with
  `context_length` renders the `"131K ctx"` badge with a properly-
  formatted `title` attribute.
- **Sketch:** Mock `[{id:"a", label:"A", context_length: 131072}]`;
  open modal; assert `getByText(/131K ctx/)`; check `title` attribute
  contains `131,072`.

### S3. `classify()` regex-branch fan-out *(A-tier)*
- **Target:** new `src/lib/errorKinds.test.ts` (or extend ErrorView).
- **Why:** `errorKinds.ts` declares four regexes with multiple
  alternations; today's tests hit one branch per regex. Priority
  ordering (e.g. blob containing both `"offline"` AND `"401"` →
  `"no-connection"` wins) is also unpinned.
- **Sketch:** `it.each` over every alternation in every regex. Plus
  three "priority" cases proving the order in `classify` is stable.

### S4. Failover trigger matrix in the gateway *(B-tier)*
- **Target:** `src-tauri/src/llm/gateway.rs#tests`.
- **Why:** Existing tests cover `401 → fallback` and `429 → fallback`.
  Missing the other status codes and the *negative* cases:
  - `500 → fallback` (server error should fall back)
  - `Cancelled → NOT fallback` (cancellation must propagate)
  - `malformed SSE chunk early in stream → NOT fallback` (today: log
    and skip the bad chunk, keep streaming the same provider)
- **Sketch:** Three `#[tokio::test]` cases. Each asserts
  `switch_calls == 1` or `0` per the contracted outcome above.

### S5. Failover state does NOT persist across completions *(B-tier)*
- **Target:** new `src-tauri/tests/failover_isolation.rs`.
- **Why:** Each `run_completion` builds fresh provider state. The
  *implicit* contract is that a previous failover doesn't make
  subsequent calls go to OpenRouter first. There's no test on this —
  an agent adding a "sticky preferred provider" cache could silently
  break it.
- **Sketch:** Two sequential `run_completion` calls; first
  Fireworks-500 + OpenRouter-OK, second Fireworks-OK only. Assert each
  mock's `received_requests().len()`: Fireworks twice, OpenRouter once.

### S6. Partial stream (server closes without `[DONE]`) *(B-tier)*
- **Target:** `src-tauri/src/llm/gateway.rs#tests`.
- **Why:** When the SSE stream ends with `None` before `[DONE]`,
  `stream_one` returns the partial buffer as `Ok`. This is a contract
  worth pinning — if anyone changes it to error on missing terminator,
  the test surfaces the decision.
- **Sketch:** Wiremock with `set_body_string` containing two valid
  `data:` lines and no `[DONE]`. Assert the returned text equals the
  concatenated tokens; assert no error.

### S7. Network connect-timeout → `GatewayError::Network` *(B-tier)*
- **Target:** `src-tauri/src/llm/gateway.rs#tests`.
- **Why:** `init_client` sets `connect_timeout(10s)`; no test exercises
  it. PI5 covers the same idea for `fetch_models` (closed local port) —
  this is the chat-completions twin.
- **Sketch:** Point `ProviderConfig.base_url` at `http://192.0.2.1`
  (TEST-NET-1, RFC 5737 — guaranteed unrouteable) with a short test
  client. Assert `matches!(err, GatewayError::Network(_))`.

### S8. Corrupt JSON in the settings store *(B-tier)*
- **Target:** `src-tauri/src/settings.rs#tests`.
- **Why:** B7 covers field add/remove; not the case where a user (or a
  bad write) leaves `settings.json` with malformed JSON. Today
  `load_blocking` returns `Err(SettingsError::Serde(_))` and the whole
  load fails. Worth pinning + deciding whether to harden to
  "log + return defaults".
- **Sketch:** Red test that locks today's behaviour. If we harden, flip
  the assertion. Either way, the test enforces the decision.

### S9. `target` parameter routes events to the right window *(B-tier)*
- **Target:** new e2e (or a Rust integration test with two windows).
- **Why:** `target = Some("playground")` is the seam that prevents
  Playground completions from polluting the panel state machine. There
  is no automated test that events with one target are not delivered to
  the other.
- **Sketch:** Mount `/panel`, fire a Playground completion via direct
  `runCompletion(_, _, "playground")`, assert ActionPicker remains
  visible (no streaming state). Pair with the inverse direction.

### S10. Auto-clipboard failure is non-fatal *(B-tier)*
- **Target:** extend `shims/plugin-clipboard-manager.ts` + a new e2e
  case in `panel.spec.ts`.
- **Why:** `completion.rs` log-don't-fails the clipboard auto-write so
  the user still sees the result. An agent porting to a fragile-clipboard
  platform might "fix" this by raising it as an error.
- **Sketch:** Add a `__TEST__.failNextClipboardWrite()` shim hook; run
  the panel happy path; assert ResultView still renders and no ErrorView
  appears.

### S11. Listeners-before-invokes invariant *(B-tier)*
- **Target:** new `tests/e2e/listeners.spec.ts`.
- **Why:** `Panel.tsx` registers all streaming-event listeners at
  mount — the load-bearing contract for not dropping the first token.
  Today no test fires `selection_captured` *before* `Panel.tsx` mounts
  to verify nothing gets lost on cold start.
- **Sketch:** Queue a `selection_captured` event on `DOMContentLoaded`
  via the shim's event bus *before* React mounts; navigate to `/panel`;
  assert the picker renders with the queued selection.

### S12. Onboarding step 4 hides OpenRouter block when no key *(A-tier)*
- **Target:** extend `tests/e2e/onboarding.spec.ts`.
- **Why:** `StepDefaultModels` conditionally hides the OpenRouter block.
  The existing step-4 test seeds Fireworks only and asserts
  `onboarding_complete` flips — it does NOT assert the OpenRouter block
  is absent.
- **Sketch:** Add `expect(page.getByTestId("openrouter-model-trigger"))
  .not.toBeVisible()` to the existing step-4 test.

### S13. Visual snapshot baseline *(C-tier)*
- **Target:** new `tests/e2e/visual.spec.ts`.
- **Why:** CSS-token regressions during refactor are invisible to the
  current suite. A Playwright `toHaveScreenshot()` baseline per panel
  state catches them.
- **Sketch:** Tight scope — panel root in `picking`, `streaming`
  (frozen token sequence), `result`, `error`. Use Playwright's
  `--update-snapshots` for the baseline.

After landing **S1 + S3 + S12** (≈ 30 min total) alongside the
existing **A5/A6/A10/A11**, an agent has enough leverage on the
panel/error/settings surfaces to safely tackle the upcoming dev-mode +
persistent-panel work (see
[`docs/specs/dev-mode-and-panel-persist.md`](../../docs/specs/dev-mode-and-panel-persist.md))
without manual smoke. The S4–S11 batch is the contract-pinning layer
that pays off most when agents start refactoring the gateway.

## Quick Command (beta — specced, not implemented)

Coverage items added in advance of
[`docs/specs/quick-command-beta.md`](../../docs/specs/quick-command-beta.md)
landing. Each row maps to a scenario the spec already enumerates; these
rows let an implementer scan one document for the test scaffolding
instead of two.

### Q1. Empty selection + flag on → QuickCommand view renders *(A-tier)*
- **Target:** new `tests/e2e/quick-command.spec.ts`.
- **Why:** Pins the new branch in `Panel.tsx` that calls
  `startQuickCommand()` instead of `setSelection(emptySelection)`.
  Without this, a future refactor could silently revert to the
  EmptySelection card and no test fails.
- **Sketch:** Seed `quick_command_enabled: true`,
  `fireworks_key: "fw_test"`; `emitSelection(page, "")`; assert the
  `data-testid="quick-command-input"` textarea is visible, focused, and
  empty; assert the Beta chip is present.

### Q2. Submit → stream → result via mocked tokens *(A-tier)*
- **Target:** `quick-command.spec.ts`.
- **Why:** Covers the new `run_quick_command` shim path end-to-end and
  asserts the `__TEST_QUICK_COMMAND__` recorder captures the typed
  prompt verbatim.
- **Sketch:** `setCompletionOverride({ kind: "stream", tokens: [...] })`;
  type a prompt; press Enter; assert `result-text` and
  `getQuickCommandSubmissions(page).at(-1).prompt` matches what was typed.

### Q3. Retry re-streams the same prompt *(A-tier)*
- **Target:** `quick-command.spec.ts`.
- **Why:** Pins that `retry()` from a quick-mode result re-invokes
  `runQuickCommand(mode.prompt)`, not `runCompletion(...)`.
- **Sketch:** From the result view click `result-retry`; assert a
  second entry in the recorder with the same prompt.

### Q4. Back from result returns to QuickCommand with prompt preserved *(A-tier)*
- **Target:** `quick-command.spec.ts`.
- **Why:** Pins the `CompletionMode.quick.prompt` round-trip through
  the store's `back()` action — the "type → submit → back → type
  more" loop is the whole UX argument for the feature.
- **Sketch:** Submit `"Hello?"`; from result click Back; assert the
  textarea is visible with value `"Hello?"`.

### Q5. Flag off falls back to EmptySelection *(A-tier)*
- **Target:** `quick-command.spec.ts`.
- **Why:** Pins the migration/compatibility promise from the spec: an
  off toggle restores the *exact* pre-feature behaviour.
- **Sketch:** Seed `quick_command_enabled: false`;
  `emitSelection(page, "")`; assert the existing
  "Select some text first" card is visible and the QuickCommand
  textarea is absent.

### Q6. Invalid-key error path → ErrorView with `invalid-key` kind *(A-tier)*
- **Target:** `quick-command.spec.ts`.
- **Why:** Confirms quick-command failures flow through the same
  `errorKinds.ts` classifier — no parallel error pipeline accidentally
  emerges.
- **Sketch:** `setCompletionOverride({ kind: "error", fireworks_error:
  "HTTP 401 Unauthorized", openrouter_error: null })`; submit; assert
  `[data-error-kind="invalid-key"]`.

### Q7. Empty-prompt Submit is a no-op *(A-tier)*
- **Target:** `quick-command.spec.ts`.
- **Why:** Pins both the UI guard (button disabled) and the absence of
  any recorder entry. Without this, a future refactor could
  unconditionally invoke `runQuickCommand("")` and rely solely on the
  backend's defense-in-depth guard.
- **Sketch:** Open QuickCommand view; assert Submit is disabled;
  press Enter; assert `__TEST_QUICK_COMMAND__` is empty and the panel
  is still in the `quick_command` state.

### Q8. Live Fireworks: `"What is 2+2?"` → result contains `4` *(B-tier; live)*
- **Target:** new `tests/e2e/quick-command-live.spec.ts` (or appended
  to `playground.spec.ts`).
- **Why:** Same role as the playground live smoke — guards against SSE
  parsing, prompt assembly, and cancellation regressions for the
  quick-command path specifically.
- **Sketch:** Skip if `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` unset; submit
  `"What is 2+2?"`; expect `result-text` to match `/\b4\b/` within a
  generous timeout.

### Q9. Live Fireworks: cancel mid-stream *(B-tier; live)*
- **Target:** same file as Q8.
- **Why:** Pins that `cancelCompletion()` works for the new command and
  no `completion_done` arrives after.
- **Sketch:** Submit a long-form prompt; once `StreamingView` is
  visible, call `cancelCompletion()` via the shim hook; assert no
  result view appears within ~3s and no error is classified.

### Q10. Live Fireworks: context-overflow → `context-overflow` error *(B-tier; live)*
- **Target:** same file as Q8.
- **Why:** End-to-end coverage of the documented overflow path, which
  is *especially* relevant for quick command — a user can type a
  multi-megabyte clipboard paste in seconds.
- **Sketch:** Submit ~200,000 chars of lorem ipsum; assert
  `[data-error-kind="context-overflow"]`; assert the primary button is
  labeled *"Switch model"*.

### Q11. `quick_command_enabled` persists across reload *(A-tier)*
- **Target:** extend `settings.spec.ts`.
- **Why:** Same regression class as A8 — the toggle ships into the
  settings store and an agent could break the persistence path
  independently of the runtime behaviour.
- **Sketch:** Mutate via `setQuickCommandEnabled(false)`,
  `page.reload()`, re-read; assert the value sticks.

### Q12. Quick-mode ResultView hides *Show original* and swaps the primary action *(A-tier)*
- **Target:** `quick-command.spec.ts`.
- **Why:** Pins that the mode-aware copy lands: there is no selection
  to "show", and the primary action is *Copy result*, not *Replace
  selection*.
- **Sketch:** After a successful quick-mode result, assert the
  `Show original` toggle is absent and the primary button's label
  contains `Copy`, not `Replace`.
